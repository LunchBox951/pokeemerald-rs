//! A bounded, underrun-safe sample ring buffer: the seam between a producer
//! of rendered PCM — in practice the integration crate's frame-driven music
//! player, pushing the `audio` crate's M4A output — and
//! [`crate::audio::AudioOutput`], which drains it once per audio device
//! callback.
//!
//! [`ring_buffer`] splits into a cloneable [`Producer`] (write side) and a
//! single [`Consumer`] (read side) sharing one fixed-capacity array of
//! atomic slots. The consumer side — the real-time device callback — never
//! takes a lock at all: it only loads and stores plain atomics, so a
//! producer stalled or descheduled mid-push can never block it.
//!
//! [`Consumer::fill`] is the hot path every consumer of a ring buffer is
//! built on — the real device callback, [`crate::resample::Resampler`], and
//! the null backend used in tests all drive it, in one bulk call per
//! callback (or, for an oversized callback the resampler bounds into several
//! fixed-size chunks, one call per chunk — see `crate::resample`). It
//! bulk-drains whatever is published into the requested slice without ever
//! blocking, and pads any shortfall with silence, adding that shortfall to
//! the underrun counter in a single consolidated update.
//! [`Consumer::pop_or_silence`] is the same "fill silence and count one
//! underrun when the buffer runs dry" rule for a single sample, retained for
//! callers that genuinely want one sample at a time.
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! The only state both sides share is `Shared::occupied`, an `AtomicUsize`
//! in `[0, capacity]`: the producer publishes with `fetch_add(Release)`
//! after its slot stores, the consumer frees with `fetch_sub(Release)` after
//! its slot loads, and each side reads it with `Acquire`, which orders every
//! slot access against the other side's. The consumer never takes
//! `Shared::head`'s mutex, which only serialises cloned producers, so a
//! producer stalled mid-push cannot block the callback. Each index is
//! reduced `% capacity` on every advance rather than left as an unbounded
//! counter: a capacity that does not divide `usize::MAX + 1` would alias
//! two sequence positions onto one slot the instant such a counter wrapped.
