//! Atomic publication of a pointer file. Unix stages through a held directory
//! (`stage_in`), so lookups and the promoting rename are relative to it; other
//! platforms stage by path (`stage`).
//!
//! The staged file is created exclusively and kept open. [`StagedFile::publish`]
//! checks that the staging name still resolves to that open file before
//! renaming, so a symlink or replacement planted at the name is refused. On
//! Unix the handle survives the rename, so the promoted entry is checked too:
//! a replacement that wins the gap between check and rename lands on the
//! pointer path but is never reported as published.
//!
//! Failures never delete. A held file's identity check cannot make a separate
//! pathname deletion conditional on that identity, so the staged or unverified
//! promoted entry is retained and its last known path reported.
